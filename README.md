# NHL-CLI
A command-line program to interact with the public NHL API.

### [Documentation](./DOCS.md)

## Installation
Make sure you have `poetry` [installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) on your machine. 

Clone the repository and run `poetry install`.

You can now run the program with `poetry run nhl`. Alternatively, running `poetry shell` will enter the virtual environment where the `nhl` executable should be available.
